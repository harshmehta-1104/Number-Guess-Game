# Number-Guess-Game
This is just a simple game created by me, as a project that I did with Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. 

In this game you have to guess a number that will be generated by computer. The range of number will be 0-20. 
With each time you enter a wrong number the score will reduce by 1. So basically you get maximum of 20 chances and if you fail to guess in 20 chance, you lose the game.
